                                                                      ASSIGNMENT - 1                                 
                                   
                                                      ELASTIC COMPUTE CLOUD ( EC2)

             EC2 is a part of compute services from amazon,where we can spin up virtual servers on the cloud. An EC2 virtual server is known as an instance.


               Launching an Instance

            Your AWS account might support both the EC2-Classic and EC2-VPC platforms, depending on when you created your account and which regions you've used. If your account supports EC2-Classic, you can launch an instance into either platform. If your account supports EC2-VPC only, you can launch an instance into a VPC only.


Launching  Instance from an AMI

When you launch an instance, you must select a configuration, known as an Amazon Machine Image (AMI). An AMI might contain the software required to act as a web server: for example, Linux, Apache etc.

                                                 for launching an instance there are  11 steps to be followed.they are:

    1) Open the Amazon EC2 console

    2) In the navigation bar at the top of the screen, the current region is displayed. Select the region for the instance.Select the region that meets your needs.

   3) From the Amazon EC2 console dashboard, choose Launch Instance.

   4) On the Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) page, choose an AMI 

                                 (a) Select the type of AMI to use in the left pane.
                                 (b)Check the Root device type listed for each AMI.   
                                 (c)Check the Virtualization type listed for each AMI.
                                 (d)Choose an AMI that meets your needs, and then choose Select.

    5) On the Choose an Instance Type page, select the hardware configuration and size of the instance to launch.To remain eligible for the free tier, choose the t2.micro instance type. 

    6) On the Configure Instance Details page, change the following settings as necessary.

                                 *Number of instances
                                 *Purchasing option
                                 *IAM role
                                 *Shutdown behavior
                                 *Enable termination protection
                                 *Monitoring
                                 *EBS-Optimized instance
                                 *Tenancy
                                 *Network interfaces
                                 *Kernel ID
                                 *RAM disk ID
                                 *Placement group
                                 *User data

    7) On the Add Storage page, you can specify volumes to attach to the instance besides the volumes specified by the AMI.

       Type,Device,Snapshot,Size,Volume Type,IOPS,Delete on Termination,Encrypted.these are some option's available in add storage page.

   8) On the Tag Instance page, specify tags for the instance by providing key and value combinations. 

  9) On the Configure Security Group page, use a security group to define firewall rules for your instance. These rules specify which incoming network traffic is delivered to your instance.

10) On the Review Instance Launch page, check the details of your instance, and make any necessary changes by clicking the appropriate Edit link.
When you are ready, choose Launch.

11) Select Choose an existing key pair, then select the key pair you created when getting set up.

To launch your instance, select the acknowledgment check box, then choose Launch Instances.


these are the steps to launch an instance,after using the instance  we can stop the instance or terminate the instance,otherwise it will cause some expenses.
